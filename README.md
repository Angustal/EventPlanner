# EventPlanner
This project aims to create an Event Planner Android App. This app is an attempt at solving a daily conundrum of event hosters - finding a suitable time for everyone to attend the event. With this app, an event hoster will create an event and invite people. These people  will login with their google account, or sign up, and calendar information will be requested from the user. With this information, the product will attempt to find non-clashing times and display these options to each event participant. The participants will then cast a vote for which times they can certainly reach. The host will then finalse the time. The event will then be added to everyone's Google Calendar or the app will keep track of the event if the user chooses to sign up. A reminder will be sent to the users at a time they prefer (whether that be 1 hour or 7 days before the event).
